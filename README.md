# Easy-Cafe
The “EASY-CAFE” is a graphical user interface attached with MySQL database. It is basically a future project, it is a time efficient project that used in cafe especially in heavy crowded cafe where customers need not to wait until the server come to them.
It also generates virtual bill based on the orders that are done. MySQL database is attached so that on every order based on table number are inserted to the database.
Database will be there at cooking compartment and GUI is present at each table of the cafe. On every 2-3 minutes database is refreshed so that cooking staff will get the orders of particular table.
